# Super-Mario-Fighters
This was my final project for my Digital Systems Laboratory (FPGA design) course. I created a two-player fighting game that can be played on an Altera Cyclone IV FPGA. The entire game is written in SystemVerilog, which is a hardware description/verification language. Gameplay photos and a video can be found in the "gameplay_examples" folder.
